It is a simple replica of some big websites like facebook.
Having a login page to log into the website, also a register page for new users.
The users can post something on the community and every user can see the update.
The feeds dynamically updates after every 1s. It is just the basic structure, there
are many things to be done. I'm going to add a friend list in it so the user can follow
other people.
